# machine_learning_trading_bot

## background
The purpose of this notebook is to create machine learning models to predict trading returns.  

This Jupyter notebook does the following:
* Implements an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.
* Adjusts the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.
* Trains a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.

Strategy Returns:
